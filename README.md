# Hostel-Student-s-Secured-Monitoring-System

This is a two phase project
Phase-1  Getting otp to mail and verify the data to grant permission to student for outing of the hostel student 
Phase-2  A biometric verification of student with associated visitors list and grant permission for studnt to go out.
In this Project we maintain the Student Information when they join the hostel.
In every hostel there is lot of students staying in. 
In most of the hostels there is no atomized tool to maintain all the track records of students and it is disadvantage for the hostels to give permissions for outing for students.
To overcome the problem we maintain the record of students and also we maintain students outing based on the parentâ€™s details verified by the OTP message sent to the concern parent number.
